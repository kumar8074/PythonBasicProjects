This is the basic python project for image processing using pillow(PIL) module for converting images from JPG to PNG format.
There are 3 main steps involved:
1. User have to give the foldername where the jpg files are located and the name of the folder where png files should save with foldername/ syntax
2. if the folder where the png files should be saved does not exists then the folder with the specified name will be created automatically 
3. The jpg folder will be looped and respective png files will be created in the new folder

NOTE: Please delete the new folder while running the code as the png files are already present no effect will be seen.
